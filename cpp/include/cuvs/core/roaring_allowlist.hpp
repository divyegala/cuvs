/**
 * @brief Owning immutable batch of exact per-query Roaring allowlists.
 *
 * Logically, the owner is a sparse matrix with one allowlist row per query and one possible column
 * per dataset row. @ref from_ids accepts one contiguous ID vector plus an indptr vector that
 * delimits independently sized query rows. Every row is sorted and encoded independently. For
 * multiple rows, all variable-length portable Roaring streams and their initialized
 * `cuco::experimental::roaring_bitmap_ref<uint32_t>` objects share one packed device allocation.
 * The batch builder uses indptr directly for segmented device radix sort and schedules
 * analysis/encoding over all containers in all rows.
 *
 * A one-row input delegates raw-index construction to cuCollections. cuVS retains the cuco owner
 * directly and materializes only its lightweight reference in cuVS device metadata; the serialized
 * payload is not copied. cuco currently emits array and bitmap containers on this path. The cuVS
 * multi-row builder emits the same array and bitmap container forms. Imported portable rows may
 * still contain run containers. Final encoding and reference initialization remain stream ordered
 * in both paths.
 *
 * IDs must be unique within each row. Setting @p pre_sorted skips sorting and promises that every
 * row is strictly increasing; ordering and uniqueness are not checked. Every ID must be smaller
 * than  dataset_rows.
